# STM32F103-CMSIS-Template
STM32F103x (Blue Pill) Project Template (Incl. blinky)<br>
This template project has everything needed to set up a CMSIS-based project using a STM32F103x, or Blue Pill module.
Running ```make clean && make``` should compile and upload the file to your Blue Tooth modoule. If it works, the built-in LED on the Blue Pill module will blink.
